## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to work around a container that has overflow hidden to add graphics that "pop out" of the element. I tried a couple of variations before landing on my final solution.

### Continued development

I want to continue working with more complex layouts to challenge myself and learn new approaches to problems. I would also like to learn new solutions to layouts I've already worked on. Improving on and building upon my previous knowledge Is something I'd like to do more.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I like this resource because it helps me learn about the specifics of a certain topic, and it helps me refresh on my previous knowledge.
